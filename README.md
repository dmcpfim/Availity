# Availity

I do not commonly use GitHub or Gradle/Maven so I am guessing I have not used them correctly.  They are both tools that most benefit in team build environments.  As I have
been working solo recently, I haven't used GitHUb much and never Gradle/Maven.

I thought spending my time learning the Mirth Channel structure and using that correctly was likely of more value for evaluating my skills for the position so that is where 
I put my time and effort.
